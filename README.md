#### Google Chrome Extension that allows you to search your Twitter bookmarks efficiently.

## About
#### A few years back, I needed to search my Twitter bookmarks (as I have too many of them) but that had never been an option. I assumed someone <i>must</i> have thought the same and done something about it -- and I was right. I found a Chrome extension that allows you to search Twitter bookmarks which was developed by GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/flybayer/"> flybayer</a> and can be found <a href="https://github.com/flybayer/twitter-bookmarks-search">here</a>.
#### However -- as incredible as his extension is and as much as it has saved me from endless scrolling through my bookmarks tab -- there were some features I personally wanted to add. That said, I am <i>not</i> using his code as a base, and instead am in the process of creating a completely new one from scratch, but crediting him for the inspiration. 

#### The decision to develop a new one is extremely recent and aside from the manifest and icons, is currenly in the planning/outlining phase. This page will be updated once I free up.
